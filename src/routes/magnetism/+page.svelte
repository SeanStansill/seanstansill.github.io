				My PhD is at the intersection of computer science, maths, and physics.
				I create, maintain and develop computer programs that simulate magnetic materials at the atomic level by solving 
				systems of stochastic differential equations (sometimes millions simultaneously). These are deployed on HPC 
				systems using CPU and GPU resources. I'm highly experienced in C++ and CUDA for production simulations,
				and high-performance Python for prototyping new algorithms, signal processing, symbolic maths, and data
				analysis and visualisation. I also use high level mathematics, physics and quantum mechanics to develop
				new highly efficient algorithms and create new theories.<br/>

		<Title>Magnetism for non-scientists</Title>
		<Content>
			<br />
			Like all materials, magnets are made of atoms. What makes a magnet different from other materials is
			that the electrons that surround the nuclei 'line up'. We normally think of electrons as tiny spheres,
			so it's counterintuitive that there is anything to align. But, due to quantum mechanics, these
			electrons have a property called spin.<br/>
			<br/>
			Outside of quantum mechanics, spin is vector &ndash; you can think of it as an arrow pointing in
			any direction with a fixed length. The spin of electrons in (anti-)ferromagnetic materials point
			(anti-)parallel to other electrons. So in a normal bar magnet &ndash; which is ferromagnetic &ndash; all
			of the electrons are pointing in the same direction. We can swap which way these spin vectors are
			pointing by applying an electric current, or by applying a magnetic field to the bar magnet. This
			is how magnetic hard drives operate; tiny magnetic regions are switched from up (<code>0</code
			>) to down (<code>1</code>) with electric currents.<br />
			<br/>
			To make more efficient memory technologies, and to create better optimized hardware for machine
			learning models, we need to understand magnetic materials at the atomic level and how that affects
			devices. Trying to measure single atoms in a bar magnet is hard, even for the best labs in the
			world. So, scientists (including me) are trying to model them using computer programs.<br />
			<br/>
			Scientists broadly have two different approaches to this problem. Some study the most fundamental
			quantum mechanical problems using techniques like quantum monte carlo but these are limited to
			~100 atoms and it is hard to use on electrical conductors. Others study much larger systems using 
			finite element and finite difference methods which can be recreated in a lab. These methods can be 
			very good at explaining qualitatively what happens in specific experiments. But, neither of these 
			methods alone are good at predicting the properties of magnets that would be used for memory or logic devices
			in a lab &ndash; especially when they're heated up or have lots of impurities.<br />
			<br/>
			My PhD research uses simulations that connect these two approaches; I model millions of individual
			magnetic moments using an equation of motion derived from quantum mechanics, but the moments are
			classical vectors which means the simulation can run very efficiently on GPUs. Atomistic modelling
			is the only way to include temperature by using random numbers (often called a stochastic
			process), which means these simulations can predict finite temperature behaviour very accurately.<br />
			<br/>
			The equation of motion my simulations solve is called the <a href='#llg' on:click={() => (llg_open = true)}>Landau-Liftshiz equation</a>.
			Each magnetic moment has its own equation (denoted <Katex equation='i'/>), and which is coupled to others via the magnetic
			interactions.
