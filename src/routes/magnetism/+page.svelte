        <Title>Magnetism for non-scientists</Title>
        <Content>
            <br/>
            Like all materials, magnets are made of atoms. What sets magnets apart from other materials is that the electrons that
            surround the nuclei 'line up'. We normally think of electrons as tiny spheres, so it's counterintuitive that there is
            anything to align. But, due to quantum mechanics, these electrons have a property called spin.<br/>
            <br/>
            Outside of quantum mechanics, spin is vector&ndash;you can think of it as an arrow pointing in any direction with a fixed
            length. The spin of electrons in (anti-)ferromagnets materials point (anti-)parallel to other electrons. 
            So in a normal bar magnet&ndash;which is ferromagnetic&ndash;all of the electrons are pointing in the same direction.
            We can swap which way these spin vectors are pointing by applying an electric current, or by applying a magnetic field
            to the bar magnet. This is how magnetic hard drives operate; tiny magnetic regions are switched from up (<code>0</code>) 
            to down (<code>1</code>) with electric currents.<br/>
            <br/>
            To make more efficient memory technologies, and to create better optimized hardware for machine learning models, we need
            to understand magnetic materials at the atomic level and how that affects devices. Trying to measure single atoms
            in a bar magnet is hard, even for the best labs in the work so scientists (including me) are trying to model them using
            computer programs.<br/>
            <br/>
            Scientists broadly have two different approaches to this problem. Some study the most fundamental quantum mechanical problems
            using techniques like quantum monte carlo but these are limited to ~100 atoms. Others study much larger systems using finite
            element and finite difference methods which can be recreated in a lab. Neither of these methods are good at predicting
            the properties of lab-made magnets that would be used for memory or logic devices&ndash;especially when they're heated up
            or have lots of impurities.<br/>
            <br/>
            My PhD research uses simulations that connect these two approaches; I model millions of individual magnetic moments using an 
            equation of motion derived from quantum mechanics, but the moments are classical vectors which means the simulation can
            run very efficiently on GPUs. Atomistic modelling is the only way to naturally include temperature, which means these simulations
            can predict finite temperature behaviour very accurately.<br/>
            <br/>
            The equation of motion is called the Landau-Liftshiz equation. Each magnetic moment has its own equation (denoted <Katex>i</Katex>),
            and which is coupled to others via the magnetic interactions.
